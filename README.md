# Parallel Statistical Recurrence Quantification Analysis

This project is a parallel implementation of the statistical RQA approach developed by myself, whose source code is
in another repo. We implement it using CUDA and C++ and test using the logistic map, only for performance 
check. 

In the folder `rqa` you can find the source code of the implementation. In the folder `PC-data` there is data regarding the machine where the tests were made. Moreover, in the folder `data` there is the actual data acquired with the tests and, at last, in the folder `report` there is the texfile with the report. There is also a pdf of it available.
